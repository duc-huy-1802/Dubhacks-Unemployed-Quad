        The Earth is like a big home for plants, animals, and people. Forests are part of that home â€” they give us oxygen, clean water, and cool places to live.
      </p>

      <h3>How science helps (simple)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Chemistry: Trees take in carbon dioxide (a gas) and turn it into food using sunlight. This helps keep the air clean.
        </li>
        <li>
          Weather & water: Forests help rain fall evenly and keep rivers healthy. When forests are gone, places can flood or dry out.
        </li>
        <li>
          Living things: Forests are homes for many animals and plants. Protecting forests means protecting their homes.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        When people report problems (like fires, illegal logging, or pollution) and volunteers help fix them, scientists can study what happened and learn how to stop it from happening again.
